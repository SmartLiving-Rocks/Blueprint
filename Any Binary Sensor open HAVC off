  name: Window open, climate off after a defined time
  description: 'Climate device like heating and cooling devices (if active) are turned
    off and go back to the previous set stage after the windows is closed again. You can also define a time before the 
    climate device turns back to its previous state. Now it supports several heating modes and different vendors like Tado. The supported
    HAVC modes are: automatic, auto, heat, heat_cool and off. If you need more please
    let me know. Happy automating!'
